# ETL-PROJECT1
ETL Project on "Total Energy Consumed per Capita, 2018"
When we try to understand ETL, it is the technique that we use to connect to source data, extract the data from those sources, transform the data 
in-memory to support the reporting requirements and then finally load the transformed data into a data warehouse using 
Microsoft tool SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services).
